ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Daniel Igoshin (a.k.a. Xeryto)

I'm a Computer Science student at Columbia University with a passion for developing software that makes a difference. My interests span across backend development, machine learning, and educational technology. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into what Iâ€™ve been working on:

Backend Development: As a Backend Software Engineer Intern at The Bulletin, I enhanced a Flask API with automated email triggers and event filtering, leading to a 10.5% increase in user acquisition within the first month.â€‹
Machine Learning: During my internship at Resola, I developed and optimized a machine learning model that automated patient feedback generation, reducing manual processing time by 40% across 50+ patient cases.â€‹
Educational Projects: Iâ€™ve engineered projects like Quillinâ€™, integrating AI-driven features to convert handwritten notes to digital text with 95% accuracy, and PricelessEdu, a custom ASP.NET Learning Management System that achieved over 800 monthly user sign-ups.â€‹
ðŸ”§ Technologies & Languages:

Python, C#, JavaScript, Java, C++, C, Swiftâ€‹
Django, Flask, FastAPI, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Node.jsâ€‹
AWS, Android SDK, Bootstrapâ€‹
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning:
